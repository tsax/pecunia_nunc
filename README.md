# Pecunia Nunc

This is my side project. The latin name means 'Money Now.' The genesis of this project was the following [tweet](https://twitter.com/peterc/status/280470229094637568).

When finished, this application should be hosted on github, and it would send out daily emails to subscribers with a listing of Kickstarter projects ending the same day, that are funded or close to being funded (> 85% of goal).

Thanks
